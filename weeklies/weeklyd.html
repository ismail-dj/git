        This week we continued with CSS stuff.  
        I chose a poem by Sarah Russel which I thought was really nice as the one I would choose for the five variations.
         I struggled a bit with using images since I did not know that images were treated as in line elements and not as boxes, which is nice to know now.
          My website pages are ones that I tried to make diverse looking and completely different with each one. 
          I did not know how to make a website that looked modern so I made them all look kinda retro but still pleasing to look at, although as I said before images did give me some challenges. 
        I also used the pre tag more often and added some ascii art to my websites.

We also had a talk about interfaces which while I did not have that much that I really thought about it, 
I think that something that was interesting was how accessibility and tech can come into conflict sometimes, 
like how websites can be unfriendly to people with disabilities such as blind people who need to be able to hear what the website says but not all websites can be. 
It can create conflict when website creators do not want to put in extra work or are not able to make their websites more usable for disabled folks but at the same time it makes said disabled people less able to access the website 
and makes the internet less friendly and more hostile to them at large.
