    <p>This week I mostly just worked on the discussion powerpoint for my team and worked on the concept for my website. <br> The plan I have right now for the 
        website is to have a 3D model of a room with multiple places to click and interact with in the room. Everything would be pre rendered since I will be stylizing <br>
        with blender and need the freestyle feature that is not available with any other java script tool. It would be kind of like those point and click games from back <br> 
        in the day but as a website. The idea I have is still very much just a work in progress but I got the very basic idea down. It still needs a lot more work but I do have<br>
        the basics of a room down in blender.
         <br> <br> I also did a presentation about internet identities. The thing that interested me is how social media changes politics. The 2011 arab spring was an obvious example but <br>
        I think that this kind of thing will become more common as time goes on and various goverments respose will be diffrent for each place. <br>
         It is interesting to think about just how much things are actually changing politically due to social media, and how much things were going to change regardless. <br>
         I think that a lot of these political protests were gonna happen regardless of social media, <br>
        since many of these issues existed beforehand but I think social media will make stuff like protests more common as more people have access to the internet.  </p>
