    <p> 
        This week i worked mostly just on the hypertext assignment that was due. I was not sure what idea to do for it. I did not know what story about me to do and <br> 
        how to apply it to a website. I decided to make my hypertext site seem like it was from the 90s since I could not use any css styling. I then decided to write about how <br>
        I gained interest in music as a small story. It's not that long of a story but I think it worked well for the assignment. I wanted there to be at least some interaction with it however <br>
        so I decided to have each page be a color in a sort of rainbow that the user can click on to get to a point in my life. It isn't much but I think it makes the page seem more colorful and charming <br>
        I already knew a bit of HTML going into this class becuase of my CIS major but it is not something I really focused on so I was very much relearning a lot of things but I managed to get the assignment <br>
        done and even managed to get audio on one of the pages using only HTML which is neat. I also found a website called gifcities which has a bunch of old geocities gifs on it which I think <br>
        added a lot to the 90s feel I kind of was looking for. Overall I think the website ended up looking good, if a bit basic.
