        If I had three lives, I'd marry you in two.
                    And the other?  That life over there 
                            at Starbucks, sitting alone, writing -- a memoir, 
                                maybe a novel or this poem.  No kids, probably,
                                    a small apartment with a view of the river,
                                and books -- lots of books and time to read.
                            Friends to laugh with; a man sometimes,
                    for a weekend, to remember what skin feels like 
        when it's alive.  I'm thinner in that life, vegan,
                    practice yoga.  I go to art films, farmers markets,
                            drink martinis in swingy skirts and big jewelry.
                                I vacation on the Maine coast and wear a flannel shirt
                                    weekend guy left behind, loving the smell of sweat
                                 and aftershave more than I do him.  I walk the beach
                             at sunrise, find perfect shell spirals and study pockmarks 
                        water makes in sand.  And I wonder sometimes
                    if I'll ever find you.
