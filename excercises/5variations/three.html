        If I had three lives, I'd marry you in two.<br>
        And the other?  That life over there <br>
        at Starbucks, sitting alone, writing -- a memoir,<br> 
        maybe a novel or this poem.  No kids, probably,<br>
        a small apartment with a view of the river,<br>
        and books -- lots of books and time to read.<br>
        Friends to laugh with; a man sometimes,<br>
        for a weekend, to remember what skin feels like<br> 
        when it's alive.  I'm thinner in that life, vegan,<br>
        practice yoga.  I go to art films, farmers markets,<br>
        drink martinis in swingy skirts and big jewelry.<br>
        I vacation on the Maine coast and wear a flannel shirt<br>
        weekend guy left behind, loving the smell of sweat<br>
        and aftershave more than I do him.  I walk the beach<br>
        at sunrise, find perfect shell spirals and study pockmarks<br> 
        water makes in sand.  And I wonder sometimes<br><br>
        if I'll ever find you.
