        <h1 style="color:greenyellow">Getting into Guitar</h1>
        <p style="color:white">I finally managed to get a guitar when my sister bought me an acoustic guitar soon after I finished high school.<br>
                                I learned a lot of the basics but didn't really get into guitar until I bought myself an electric a year later when I then learned many of my favorite songs<br>
                                I was getting more into stuff like shoegaze and dream pop bands such as My Bloody Valentine or Lush which relied on guitar effects<br>
                                Eventually I started to take guitar lessons which improved my skills immensely. I also started to learn music theory which helped my skill<br>
                                Since I learned some theory I was able to actually make my own songs unlike <a href="yellow.html" style="color:yellow">before.</a><br><br>
