    <p style="color:white">
                             I continued to explore more music genres and got more into hardcore and emo music. Some of my favorite bands were
                             At The Drive In, Sunny Day Real Estate. I also tried to start making some music. <a href="red.html" style="color:red"> Back in the day</a> I was interested in video game music<br>
                             so I tried to make some of that kind of music but it failed because I had no idea how to make music and wasn't really intrested in learning theory or even the basics of music
                             I eventually gave up trying to make videogame music and decided to pick up a stringed instrument since I listened to rock music the most.<br>
                             I didn't have a guitar at the time so I practiced on my sisters ukulele which was still a lot of fun to learn basic songs to sing along with.<br>
