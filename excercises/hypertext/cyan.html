    <p style="color:white">
                             After a while of practice, I managed to learn how to make music. This is still an ongoing process and I still wouldn't call myself good but I am learning!<br>
                             I also learned how to play music and jam with other people which let me meet a lot of cool new people and make new friends!<br>
                             Here is a little clip of music I made a while back:<br><br>
